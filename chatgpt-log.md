ChatGPT:
> Sure, I can help you learn the basics of building a Chip-8 emulator!

> First, let's start with some basic background information. The Chip-8 is an interpreted programming language that was created in the 1970s for use on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 home computers. It was designed to make it easier to create simple video games. Chip-8 programs are written in hexadecimal and are typically stored in a 4KB ROM.

> Load the ROM file into memory
> The first step in building a Chip-8 emulator is to load the ROM file into memory. The ROM file is a binary file that contains the Chip-8 program you want to emulate. The Chip-8 has a 4KB memory space, so you'll need to allocate 4KB of memory to store the program.

> This code first checks that the correct number of arguments were passed to the program (the name of the program itself and the ROM file). It then allocates an array of 4KB to store the Chip-8's memory space. The ROM file is opened for reading, and the fread function is used to read the contents of the file into memory starting at address 0x200 (the start address of Chip-8 programs). Finally, the ROM file is closed and the program moves on to the emulation loop.

> Set up the Chip-8's registers
> Once the ROM file is loaded into memory, you'll need to set up the Chip-8's registers. The Chip-8 has 16 general-purpose registers (V0-VF), each 8 bits in size. It also has a 16-bit program counter (PC) and a 16-bit index register (I).

> This code uses a while loop to continuously fetch and decode instructions from the ROM file. The instruction variable is set to the current instruction by combining the two bytes of memory at the program counter (PC). The instruction is then decoded by examining the first nibble (4 bits) of the instruction (instruction & 0xF000) and executing the appropriate code for that instruction.

> Render the Chip-8's display on the screen

ChatGPT:
> the Chip-8's display. The init_graphics() function initializes SDL and creates a window and renderer with a logical size of 64x32 pixels. The render_display() function takes an array of bytes (display) representing the Chip-8's display and draws each pixel as a rectangle on the screen.
>
> Note that the code above assumes a pixel size of 10, which means that each Chip-8 pixel is rendered as a 10x10 rectangle on the screen. You can adjust this value to make the display larger or smaller.

> Implement the instruction opcodes
> The most challenging part of building a Chip-8 emulator is implementing the instruction opcodes. There are 35 opcodes in total, each with its own unique behavior.
>
> To implement the opcodes, you'll need to refer to the Chip-8 instruction set and write code to handle each opcode. Here's an example of how to handle the 0x00E0 opcode, which clears the display:

> To play Chip-8 games, the emulator must respond to user input. The Chip-8 has a 16-key keypad, which can be mapped to the keyboard or a gamepad.

Me:
> Would C or Rust be a better language to use for this?

> ChatGPT:
> Both C and Rust are viable options for building a Chip-8 emulator. Both languages offer low-level control over system resources, making them well-suited for this kind of project. Here are some factors to consider when choosing between C and Rust:
>
> Familiarity: If you're more familiar with C than Rust, you may find it easier to build the emulator in C. Likewise, if you're more familiar with Rust than C, you may prefer to use Rust.
>
> Safety: Rust has a reputation for being a safer language than C, thanks to its ownership and borrowing system. Rust's compiler checks for memory safety violations at compile-time, preventing many common bugs that are possible in C. If you're concerned about safety, you may prefer to use Rust.
>
> Performance: Both C and Rust are known for their performance, but C may be slightly faster due to its simpler memory model. However, the difference in performance is likely to be negligible for a Chip-8 emulator.
>
> Libraries: C has a larger and more mature ecosystem of libraries than Rust, which may make it easier to find libraries to handle tasks such as audio output or input handling. Rust's ecosystem is growing rapidly, however, and it's possible that there are already libraries available for building a Chip-8 emulator.
>
> Ultimately, the choice between C and Rust depends on your personal preferences and experience. Both languages are capable of building a Chip-8 emulator, and you can use whichever language you feel most comfortable with.
